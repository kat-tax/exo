# Getting Started

## Overview

EXO is a skeleton project for your next React Native project.

It is a starter kit, dev stack, design system, and an opinionated set of tools and patterns for developing your next cross-platform app.

## Start with the CLI

Scaffold a new project with [ULT](https://ult.dev)

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx ult
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create ult
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create ult
```

```bash [bun]
bun x ult
```

:::

## Start with Figma

1. Go to the [Figma -> React Native](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/821138713091291738) plugin page
2. Press `Open in...` and select `Playground File`
3. Run the plugin and go to the `Export` tab
4. Press the `Download Components` button

## Manual Installation

You can install Vocs in an existing project, or start from scratch, by installing Vocs as a dependency.

::::steps

### Install

First, we will install `react-native-exo` as a dependency in our project.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i react-native-exo
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i react-native-exo
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add react-native-exo
```

```bash [bun]
bun i react-native-exo
```

:::

### Add Scripts to `package.json`

After that, let's add some scripts to our `package.json` for Vocs.

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": { // [!code focus]
    "docs:dev": "vocs dev", // [!code focus] 
    "docs:build": "vocs build", // [!code focus]
    "docs:preview": "vocs preview" // [!code focus]
  } // [!code focus]
}
```

### Build your First Page

Create a directory called `docs`, and add a file inside of it called `index.mdx` under a `pages` directory:

```
my-project/      
├── docs/                // [!code focus]
│   ├── pages/           // [!code focus]
│   │   └── index.mdx   // [!code focus]
├── node_modules/
└── package.json  
```

```markdown [docs/pages/index.mdx]
# Hello, World! [This is my first page]

Welcome to my docs. 
```

### Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

Then open up your browser to `http://localhost:5173`, and you can see your first page!
