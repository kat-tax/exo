// @noErrors
import React from 'react';
// ---cut---
// @log: ↓ Import the component
import {GestureProvider} from 'react-exo/gesture'; // [!code focus]

// @log: ↓ Wrap your application with the provider
<GestureProvider> // [!code focus]
  {/* Your application */}
</GestureProvider> // [!code focus]
```
