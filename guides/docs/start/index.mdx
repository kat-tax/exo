# Welcome to EXO

EXO is a collection of primitives, components, hooks, and utilities for React Native. It is also a starter kit, dev stack, design system, and an opinionated set of tools and patterns for developing your next cross-platform app.

## New Project

You can use either [Figma](/start/figma) or the [CLI](/start/command) to create a new EXO project.

*Either method will create a new EXO project with the following structure:*

```yml
├── client/          # React Native app source code for all platforms
├── design/          # UI kit containing components, assets, and themes
├── guides/          # MDX documentation for the doc site and storybook
├── library/         # Primitives, services, hooks, and other utilities
├── locales/         # Extracted PO translation files for each locale
├── output/          # The web app, docs, and storybook distributables
├── toolkit/         # Build + deploy tools, storybook, and doc site
├── config.yaml      # Master config file used throughout the project
├── locales.ts       # Source and target locales used for translating
└── package.json     # Monorepo package to manage the entire project
```

## Existing Project

Follow [these steps](/start/manual) to add EXO to an existing React Native project.
