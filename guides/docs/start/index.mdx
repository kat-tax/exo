# Welcome to EXO

EXO is a collection of primitives, components, hooks, and utilities for React Native. It is also a starter kit, dev stack, design system, and an opinionated set of tools and patterns for developing your next cross-platform app.

## New Project

You can use either [Figma](/start/figma) or the [CLI](/start/command) to create a new EXO project.

*Either method will create a new EXO project with the following structure:*

```yml
project/
├── client/            # The React Native app source code for all platforms
├── design/            # UI kit containing components, assets, and the theme
├── guides/            # MDX documentation for the doc site and storybook
├── library/           # 
├── locales/           #
├── output/            #
├── toolkit/           #
│   ├── builder/       #
│   ├── config/        #
│   ├── fastlane/      #
│   └── storybook/     #
├── config.yaml        # Master config file used throughout the project
├── locales.ts         # Configure your source and target languages here
└── package.json       # Monorepo package, run all scripts from here
```

## Existing Project
